synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . 
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . [p]
comments : <M />stalked<M /> is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . [e]
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . [e][g]
<M />stalked<M /> wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . [p]
other than that , <M />stalked<M /> is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . [e]
<M />stalked<M /> does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . [e]
interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . [g]
after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . [o]
the narrator states that " this is the story of <C />daryl gleason<C  /> " and tells the audience that he is the stalker . [p]
of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur <C />brooke daniels<C  /> . [e]
if the movie was meant to be about <C />daryl<C  /> , then it should have been called stalker not <M />stalked<M /> . [g]
okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . [o]
<M />stalked<M /> proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . [e]
the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings <C />daryl<C  /> and <C />brooke<C  /> ( the victim ) together . [p]
<C />daryl<C  /> obsesses over <C />brooke<C  /> , follows her around , and tries to woo her . [p]
ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . [p]
these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . [p][e]
for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim <M />stalked<M /> . [e]
<M />stalked<M /> is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . [p]
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and <M />stalked<M /> , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . [p]
<M />stalked<M />'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . [e]
<A />jay underwood<A /> , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . [e]
he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . [g]
<A />maryam d'abo<A /> , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " <M />stalked<M /> " of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . [e][g]
<C />brooke<C  /> ( <A />d'abo<A /> ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . [e]
toward the end , for example , <C />brooke<C  /> has her suspicions about <C />daryl<C  /> . [p]
to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , <C />brooke<C  /> decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . [p]
does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? [o]
of course not . [p]
she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . [p]
when <C />daryl<C  /> returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . [p]
somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , <C />daryl<C  /> is oblivious to her presence inside . [p]
the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . [e]
<M />stalked<M /> receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . [e][g]
rated <R />r<R /> mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . [e]
if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . [e]
