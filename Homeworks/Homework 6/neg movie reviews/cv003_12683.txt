 <M />" quest for camelot "<M /> is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried .[e] 
the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production <O />" anastasia , "<O /> but disney's <O />" hercules , "<O /> with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . [e]
this year , it's no contest , as <M />" quest for camelot "<M /> is pretty much dead on arrival . [e]
even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be <O />" pocahontas "<O /> for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . [e]
the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited <C />kayley<C /> ( voiced by <A />jessalyn gilsig<A /> ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from <C />king arthur's<C /> round table . [p]
<C />kayley's<C /> only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord <C />ruber<C /> ( <A />gary oldman<A /> ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals <C />arthur's<C /> magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a <S />dangerous , booby-trapped forest<S /> . [p]
with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller <C />garrett<C /> ( <A />carey elwes<A /> ) and a two-headed dragon ( <A />eric idle<A /> and <A />don rickles<A /> ) that's always arguing with itself , <C />kayley<C /> just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on <C />arthur's<C /> side . [p]
 <M />" quest for camelot "<M /> is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . [e]
there's nothing here that differentiates <M />" quest "<M /> from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . [e]
 ( compare<C />kayley<C /> and <C />garrett's<C /> run-in with the angry ogre to <C />herc's<C /> battle with the hydra . [o]
i rest my case . [o]) 
even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others .[e] 
in the end , it's a tie -- they all win . [p]
that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse .[e]
at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find <A />jaleel " urkel " white<A /> and <A />bronson " balki " pinchot<A /> sharing the same footage . [e]
a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . [e]
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . [e][g]
aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , <M />" quest for camelot "<M /> 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . [e]
and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . [e]
