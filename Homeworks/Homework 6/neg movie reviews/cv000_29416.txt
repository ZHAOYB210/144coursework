plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . [p]
they get into an accident . [p]
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . [p]
what's the deal ? 
watch the movie and " sorta " find out . . . 
critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . [e]
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( <O />lost highway<O /> & <O />memento<O /> ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . [e]
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . [g]
so what are the problems with the movie ? [o]
well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . [e]
it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . [g]
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . [g]
now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . [e]
it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . [g]
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? 
not really . [e]
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . [o]
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is " into it " even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . [o]
i mean , showing <A />melissa sagemiller<A /> running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ![e][g] 
okay , we get it . . . there 
are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . [o]
do we really need to see it over and over again ? [o]
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? [o]
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . [e]
there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess " the suits " decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . [o]
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although <A />wes bentley<A /> just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in <O />american beauty<O /> , only in a new neighborhood . [e]
but my biggest kudos go out to <A /> sagemiller<A /> , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . [e]
overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . [e]
oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's 
just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . [e]
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .[o] 
whatever . . . skip 
it ! [o]
