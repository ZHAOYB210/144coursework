<M />you've got mail<M /> works alot better than it deserves to . [e]
in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . [g]
no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of <O />the shop around the corner<O /> , only adding a few modern twists ) . [e]
essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . [e]
it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . [e]
but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . [e]
but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous <A />ryan<A />/<A />hanks<A /> teaming , <O />sleepless in seattle<O /> . [e]
it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . [e]
i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about <M />you've got mail<M /> , but then again , is that really important ? [o]
if you like something so much , why even question it ? [o]
again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . [e]
<A />tom hanks<A /> plays <C />joe fox<C /> , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and <A />meg ryan<A /> plays <C />kathleen kelley<C /> , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . [p]
<C />fox<C /> and <C />kelley<C /> soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . [p]
little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . [p]
the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . [e]
sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . [e]
all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . [p][e]
but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . [e]
when <A />ryan<A /> discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . [e][o]
