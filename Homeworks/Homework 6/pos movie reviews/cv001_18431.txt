every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . [e]
mtv films'<M />_election<M /> , a high school comedy starring <A />matthew broderick<A /> and <A />reese witherspoon<A /> , is a current example . [e]
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? [o]
the plot is deceptively simple . [e]
<S />george washington carver high school<S /> is having student elections . [e]
<C />tracy flick<C /> ( <A />reese witherspoon<A /> ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . [p]
<C />mr . " m "<C /> ( <A />matthew broderick<A /> ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages <C />paul<C /> , a popular-but-slow jock to run . [p]
and <C />paul<C />'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . [p]
the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . [e][g]
you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . [e]
<M />_election<M /> , a good film , does not live up to its hype . [e]
what makes <M />_election_<M /> so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from <O />_rushmore_<O /> , released a few months earlier . [e]
the similarities are staggering : [e]
<C />tracy flick<C /> ( <M />_election_<M /> ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . [p][g]
max fischer ( <O />_rushmore_<O /> ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . [g]
the most significant tension of <M />_election_<M /> is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . [p][g]
the most significant tension of <O />_rushmore_<O /> is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . [g]
<C />tracy flick<C /> is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . [p][g]
max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . [g]
the male bumbling adult in <M />_election_<M /> ( <A />matthew broderick<A /> ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . [p][g]
he even gets a bee sting . [p]
the male bumbling adult in <O />_rushmore_<O /> ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . [g]
he gets several bee stings . [g]
and so on . [o]
what happened ? [o]
how is it that an individual screenplay ( <O />_rushmore_<O /> ) and a novel ( <M />_election_<M /> ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? [o]
even so , the strengths of <M />_election_<M /> rely upon its fantastic performances from <A />broderick<A /> , <A />witherspoon<A /> , and newcomer <A/ >jessica campbell<A /> , as <C />paul<C />'s anti-social sister , <C />tammy<C /> . [e]
<A />broderick<A /> here is playing the mr . rooney role from <O />_ferris bueller_<O /> , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . [e]
<A />witherspoon<A /> is a revelation . [e]
it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , <A />witherspoon<A /> deserves an oscar nomination . [e]
and once <A />campbell's<A /> character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . [e][p]
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . [o]
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . [e]
i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . [o]
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . [o]
as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . [e]
it is bad enough that <C />mr . m<C /> doesn't like <C />tracy's<C /> determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? [p]
even so , there's no logical reason why <C />mr . m<C /> has an affair when he does . [e]
there's a lot to like in <M />_election_<M /> , but the plot similarities to <O />_rushmore_<O /> , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . [e]
