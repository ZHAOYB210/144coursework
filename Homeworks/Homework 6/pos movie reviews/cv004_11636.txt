moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . [e] 
every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . [o]
in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . [e]
in the movies , you end up with films like <O />" spawn "<O /> , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . [o]
<A />jackie chan<A /> is the barry sanders of moviemaking . [e]
he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . [g]
watching <A />jackie<A /> in <M />operation condor<M /> as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . [p][e]
but like the lions star , <A />jackie<A /> doesn't have anybody to block for him . [o]
almost every cent that's invested in a <A />jackie chan<A /> movie goes for stunts , and as <A />chan<A /> does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . [e][o]
this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( <A />chan<A /> directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . [e]
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . [e]
 ( <A />chan's<A /> first release in this country , <O />" rumble in the bronx "<O /> , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) [o]
heck , <A />jackie<A /> doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . [e][g]
in condor , <A />chan<A /> plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of <A />bruce lee<A /> and <A />tim allen<A /> , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . [e]
<A />jackie<A /> is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about <A />jackie chan<A /> movies : no political correctness ) .[p] 
he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , " <A />jackie<A /> , save us ! " , and misuse firearms . [p]
the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . [p][e]
en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . [p]
once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . [p][e]
this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . [e][o]
ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . [o][p]
don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . [o]
just go see the movie . [o]
<M />operation condor<M /> has pretentions of being a <O />" raiders of the lost ark "<O /> knockoff , but one wonders what <A />jackie<A /> could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , <M />condor<M /> might be an a+ movie . [e]
however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in <A />jackie chan<A /> is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . [e]
