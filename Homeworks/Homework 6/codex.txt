<R /> = Rating, in terms of what age group the film is appropriate for. This initially seems very helpful, but only a couple of the movie reviews list rating, and those that do list 'R.'
<L /> = Length, for how long the film runs for. Similarly, this is listed few times in the reviews, and in different formats e.g. 2:00 vers 'about two hours.' Thus sometimes digits are tagged while other times strings are tagged.
<P /> = Production, this tag captures all who helped make the movie but aren't in the movie (writers, directors etc). This tag is very broad as it is not always evident what role a mentioned person played in production. Additionally sometimes people are directors and actors and would have multiple tags. 
<S /> = Setting, this tag marks when something describes the location or time period in the movie. This can be problematic because some setting descriptions are quite long.
