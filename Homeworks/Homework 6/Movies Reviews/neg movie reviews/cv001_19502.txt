the happy bastard's quick movie review [o]
damn that y2k bug . [o]
it's got a head start in this movie starring <A />jamie lee curtis<A /> and another <A />baldwin<A /> brother ( <A />william<A /> this time ) in a story regarding a crew of <S />a tugboat<S /> that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . [p]
little do they know the power within . . . [e]
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , <M />virus<M /> still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . [e]
we don't know why the crew was really out in the <S />middle of nowhere<S /> , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why <A />donald sutherland<A /> is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . [p][e]
here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " .[p][e] 
the acting is below average , even from the likes of <A />curtis<A /> . [e]
you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in <O />halloween h20<O /> . [e]
<A />sutherland<A /> is wasted and <A />baldwin<A /> , well , he's acting like a <A />baldwin<A /> , of course . [e]
the real star here are <P />stan winston's<P /> robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . [e]
so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . [e]
otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . [e]
