capsule : in <S />2176<S /> on the <S />planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . [p]
there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . [p][e]
<P />john carpenter<P /> reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially <O />assault on precinct 13<O /> , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . [e]
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . 
<P />john carpenter<P /> apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . [e]
for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . [e]
<M /> ghosts of mars<M /> is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . [g]
in addition if anybody but <P />john carpenter<P /> had made <M />ghosts of mars<M /> , <P />carpenter<P /> would have grounds to sue . [e]
this film is just chock full of pieces taken from <O />assault on precinct 13<O /> , <O />the thing<O /> , and <O />prince of darkness<O /> . [g]
it is , in fact , surprising that <P />carpenter<P /> managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . [e]
but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . [e]
<M />ghosts of mars<M /> takes place in the <S />year 2176<S /> . [p]
<S />mars<S /> has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) . [p]
it is never mentioned , but the gravity on <S />mars<S /> has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . [p]
society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . [e]
apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . [p]
and from <P />carpenter's<P /> view , women have really made a mess of things . [p]
society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . [p]
the basic plot of <M />ghosts of mar<M />s has much in common with that of <O />assault on precinct 13<O /> except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown <S />martian mining colony<S /> . [e][g]
instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal <C />" desolation " williams <C />. [o]
instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . [p]
because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . [p]
the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . [o]
 <M />ghosts of mars<M /> takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . [o]
<P />carpenter<P /> manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . [p][e]
sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . [e]
the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . [e]
his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . [g]
these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . [e]
somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . [e]
within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of <O />mission to mars<O /> ,<O /> red planet<O /> , and  <M />ghosts of mars <M /> . [o]
after <O />mission to mars<O /> was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . [e]
i rate <M />ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . [e]
following the movie i showed my wife , who liked <M />ghosts of mars<M /> moderately more than i did , <P />carpenter's<P /> classic <O />assault on precinct 13<O />. [o]
her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . [g]
