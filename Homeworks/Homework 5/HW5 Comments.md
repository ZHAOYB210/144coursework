#### Overall

This is excellent work. The solution on Problem 7 is quite advanced.

#### Correctness

Excellent. Here's another solution to Problem 5 (using negative lookahead): `<.*?>(?![>"])`. It's not really any less stipulative, though.

#### Readability

Good. The regex for Problem 6 is quite complicated, considering that it returns more than the three values we want. See my specific comments for a simpler solution.

#### Documentation

Excellent.

#### Efficiency

Excellent overall. The problem under 'readability' is also sort of an efficiency issue, given how regular expressions are processed.
