#### Overall

This is an excellent solution. There are a few issues as noted in the interlinear comments, but they are minor. Well done.

#### Correctness

Excellent overall. The output for Problem 2 doesn't strip colons, but the other outputs are all perfect.

#### Readability

Good. It's a good idea to make use of the verbose flag with regular expressions so that you can add linebreaks and such to the complex ones.

#### Documentation

Excellent. Very clear.

#### Efficiency

The simplicity of the solution to Problem 4 is excellent.
