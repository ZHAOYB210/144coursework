#### Overall

This is very good to excellent work. More specifically, Problems 1-4 are excellent across the board, but since Problem 5 is unanswered (and we'd extended the deadline a week), that lowers the overall evaluation a bit.

#### Correctness

Excellent. Problem 2 in particular is a model solution. Problem 3 is also very clever.

#### Readability

Excellent. No complaints.

#### Documentation

Excellent overall. The one failing is populating the phoneme list in Problem 3. Using the set is a great idea, but it should be explained.

#### Efficiency

Excellent.
