And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing downbefore the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in herlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in gladholiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailinground among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous topointing her prow for home.The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red buntingat their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of thelast whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colourswere flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each ofher three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in hertop-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same preciousfluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprisingsuccess; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the sameseas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing asingle fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away tomake room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplementalcasks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these werestowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms.Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and thecabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to thefloor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actuallycaulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorouslyadded, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, andfilled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filledit; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons andfilled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except thecaptain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his handsinto, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, thebarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawingstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her hugetry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach skin ofthe black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenchedhands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers weredancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from thePolynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly securedaloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, withglittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilariousjig. Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy atthe masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had beenremoved. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursedBastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick andmortar were being hurled into the sea.Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on theship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama wasfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individualdiversion.And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other'swakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodingsas to things to come--their two captains in themselves impersonated thewhole striking contrast of the scene."Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander, liftinga glass and a bottle in the air."Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply."No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the othergood-humoredly. "Come aboard!""Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?""Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,old hearty, come along. I'll soon take that black from your brow. Comealong, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.""How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou arta full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an emptyship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the otherstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crewof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the recedingBachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the livelyrevelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed thehomewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, andthen looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing tworemote associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucketsoundings.Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favouritessail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of therushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemedit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimsonfight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sunand whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and suchplaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, thatit almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys ofthe Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, hadgone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sternedoff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the nowtranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whalesdying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring--that strangespectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed awondrousness unknown before."He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, hishomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He tooworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!--Ohthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe;in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocksfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have stillrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon theNiger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; butsee! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it headssome other way."Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast buildedthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in thewide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Norhas this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone roundagain, without a lesson to me."Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowedjet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, ohwhale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, thatonly calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darkerhalf, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamableimminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once livingthings, exhaled as air, but water now."Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wildfowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; thoughhill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!"The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far towindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. Theselast three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward onecould not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it layby its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; andthe lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glareupon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, whichgently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouchingin the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round thewhale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A soundlike the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts ofGomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; andhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in aflooded world. "I have dreamed it again," said he."Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse norcoffin can be thine?""And who are hearsed that die on the sea?""But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, twohearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made bymortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown inAmerica.""Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumesfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such asight we shall not soon see.""Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.""And what was that saying about thyself?""Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.""And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I canfollow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it notso? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here twopledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.""Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted uplike fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee.""The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea," criedAhab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and theslumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the deadwhale was brought to the ship.The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman wouldostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run tothe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixedon the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship'sprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon highnoon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, wasabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine hislatitude.Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets ofeffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazingfocus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass. The sky lookslacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakednessof unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God's throne.Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, throughwhich to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated formto the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrumentplaced to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments tocatch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian.Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneelingbeneath him on the ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's,was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hoodedtheir orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil uponhis ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at thatprecise instant. Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked uptowards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high andmighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou cast theleast hint where I SHALL be? Or canst thou tell where some other thingbesides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thoumust be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that iseven now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equallybeholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!"Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, itsnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:"Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, andCaptains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but whatafter all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thouthyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holdsthee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of wateror one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotencethou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursedbe all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that heaven, whose livevividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorchedwith thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth's horizon are theglances of man's eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if Godhad meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!"dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee;the level ship's compass, and the level deadreckoning, by log and byline; THESE shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,"lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I trample on thee, thou paltrything that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!"As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his liveand dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and afatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed overthe mute, motionless Parsee's face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clusteredtogether on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,shouted out--"To the braces! Up helm!--square in!"In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled uponher heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised uponher long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on onesufficient steed.Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod'stumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck."I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full ofits tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine,what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!""Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahabmutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine;swears that I must play them, and no others.' And damn me, Ahab, butthou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!"Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengalcrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgentbut basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoesthat never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in theseresplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of allstorms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that cloudlesssky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, andbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directlyahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with thethunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled mastsfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of thetempest had left for its after sport.Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at everyflash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disastermight have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flaskwere directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of theboats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the verytop of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape.A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship's highteetering side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern, and left itagain, all dripping through like a sieve."Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,"but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can't fight it. You see,Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, allround the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, allthe start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But nevermind; it's all in fun: so the old song says;"--(SINGS.)  Oh! jolly is the gale,  And a joker is the whale,  A' flourishin' his tail,--  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!  The scud all a flyin',  That's his flip only foamin';  When he stirs in the spicin',--  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!  Thunder splits the ships,  But he only smacks his lips,  A tastin' of this flip,--  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike hisharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thypeace.""But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut mythroat. And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for awind-up.""Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.""What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, nevermind how foolish?""Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing hishand towards the weather bow, "markest thou not that the gale comes fromthe eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the verycourse he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where isthat stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand--hisstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thoumust!"I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?""Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way toNantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb'squestion. "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn itinto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see it lightens upthere; but not with the lightning."At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, followingthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the sameinstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead."Who's there?""Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to hispivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowedlances of fire.Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry offthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea someships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. Butas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end mayavoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantlytowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interferingnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding thevessel's way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of aship's lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally madein long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into thechains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require."The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished tovigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux,to light Ahab to his post. "Are they overboard? drop them over, fore andaft. Quick!""Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the weakerside. Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, thatall the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.""Look aloft!" cried Starbuck. "The corpusants! the corpusants!"All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at eachtri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each ofthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, likethree gigantic wax tapers before an altar."Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashingsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violentlyjammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. "Blast it!"--butslipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; andimmediately shifting his tone he cried--"The corpusants have mercy on usall!"To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance ofthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate cursesfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seethingsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath whenGod's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His "Mene, Mene,Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from theenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far awayconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the giganticjet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemedthe black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth ofTashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed asif they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by thepreternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic blueflames on his body.The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once morethe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A momentor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. Itwas Stubb. "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not thesame in the song.""No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and Ihope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?--havethey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too darkto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a signof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to bechock a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that sperm willwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts willyet be as three spermaceti candles--that's the good promise we saw."At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginningto glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and oncemore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubledsupernaturalness in their pallor."The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head bowed awayfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, wherethey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like aknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchantedattitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons inHerculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyesupcast."Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab. "Look up at it; mark it well; the whiteflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmastlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it;blood against fire! So."Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his footupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, hestood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames."Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persianonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that tothis hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I nowknow that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverencewilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and allare killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life willdispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of thepersonified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a point atbest; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go; yet while I earthly live,the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But waris pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of love, and I willkneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power;and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's thatin here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thyfire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back tothee."[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrungfrom me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can thengrope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage ofthese poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightningflashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beatenbrain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh!Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thouleapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leapingout of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn theflames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thouart but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! whathast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten;certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. Iknow that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whomall thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Throughthee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thoufoundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicableriddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with haughty agony, I readmy sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn withthee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!""The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashedin its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat'sbow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leathersheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came alevelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned therelike a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm--"God, Godis against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill begun, illcontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make afair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to thebraces--though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghastmate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. Butdashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching theburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing totransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end.Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dartthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:--"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; andheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that yemay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow outthe last fear!" And with one blast of his breath he extinguished theflame.As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood ofsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it somuch the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts;so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from himin a terror of dismay."We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working looseand the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?""Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them upnow.""Sir!--in God's name!--sir?""Well.""The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?""Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.--Bymasts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of somecoasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiesttrucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine nowsails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowardssend down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloftthere! I would e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colicis a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!""No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but youwill never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how longago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn't you once say thatwhatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on itsinsurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aftand boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn't you say so?""Well, suppose I did? What then? I've part changed my flesh since thattime, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with powderbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers getafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you havepretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself; you'reAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coatcollar. Don't you see, then, that for these extra risks the MarineInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. Buthark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg offfrom the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;now listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a mast'slightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn'tgot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you timber-head,that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is firststruck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundredcarries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no moredanger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousandships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you wouldhave every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod runningup the corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather,and trailing behind like his sash. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it'seasy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can besensible.""I don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.""Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that'sa fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch theturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchorsnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these twoanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And whatbig generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists,hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world isanchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable,though. There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So; next totouching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, justwring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togsso, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be wornin all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carryoff the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-endeave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; Imust mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew!there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that comefrom heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.""Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What'sthe use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don't want thunder; we want rum; giveus a glass of rum. Um, um, um!"
