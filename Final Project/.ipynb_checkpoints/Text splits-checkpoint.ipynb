      "All matter is composed of certain constituents (about seventy are at\n",
      "present known), which, so far as the chemist is concerned, are\n",
      "indivisible, and are known as elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the innumerable combinations of these elements, two general classes\n",
      "may be recognized, organic and inorganic bodies. While it is\n",
      "impossible, owing to the dependence of all organized matter upon\n",
      "inorganic matter, to give an absolute definition, we at once recognize\n",
      "the peculiarities of organic or living bodies as distinguished from\n",
      "inorganic or non-living ones. All living bodies feed, grow, and\n",
      "reproduce, these acts being the result of the action of forces\n",
      "resident within the organism. Inorganic bodies, on the other hand,\n",
      "remain, as a rule, unchanged so long as they are not acted upon by\n",
      "external forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "All living organisms are dependent for existence upon inorganic\n",
      "matter, and sooner or later return these elements to the sources\n",
      "whence they came. Thus, a plant extracts from the earth and air\n",
      "certain inorganic compounds which are converted by the activity of the\n",
      "plant into a part of its own substance, becoming thus incorporated\n",
      "into a living organism. After the plant dies, however, it undergoes\n",
      "decomposition, and the elements are returned again to the earth and\n",
      "atmosphere from which they were taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigation has shown that living bodies contain comparatively few\n",
      "elements, but these are combined into extraordinarily complex\n",
      "compounds. The following elements appear to be essential to all living\n",
      "bodies: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, potassium.\n",
      "Besides these there are several others usually present, but not\n",
      "apparently essential to all organisms. These include phosphorus, iron,\n",
      "calcium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine, silicon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we examine more closely the structure and functions of organic\n",
      "bodies, an extraordinary uniformity is apparent in all of them. This\n",
      "is disguised in the more specialized forms, but in the simpler ones is\n",
      "very apparent. Owing to this any attempt to separate absolutely the\n",
      "animal and vegetable kingdoms proves futile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The science that treats of living things, irrespective of the\n",
      "distinction between plant and animal, is called \"Biology,\" but for\n",
      "many purposes it is desirable to recognize the distinctions, making\n",
      "two departments of Biology,--Botany, treating of plants; and Zo\u00f6logy,\n",
      "of animals. It is with the first of these only that we shall concern\n",
      "ourselves here.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one takes up a plant his attention is naturally first drawn to\n",
      "its general appearance and structure, whether it is a complicated one\n",
      "like one of the flowering plants, or some humbler member of the\n",
      "vegetable kingdom,--a moss, seaweed, toadstool,--or even some still\n",
      "simpler plant like a mould, or the apparently structureless green scum\n",
      "that floats on a stagnant pond. In any case the impulse is to\n",
      "investigate the form and structure as far as the means at one's\n",
      "disposal will permit. Such a study of structure constitutes\n",
      "\"Morphology,\" which includes two departments,--gross anatomy, or a\n",
      "general study of the parts; and minute anatomy, or \"Histology,\" in\n",
      "which a microscopic examination is made of the structure of the\n",
      "different parts. A special department of Morphology called\n",
      "\"Embryology\" is often recognized. This embraces a study of the\n",
      "development of the organism from its earliest stage, and also the\n",
      "development of its different members.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a study of the structure of organisms we get a clue to their\n",
      "relationships, and upon the basis of such relationships are enabled to\n",
      "classify them or unite them into groups so as to indicate the degree\n",
      "to which they are related. This constitutes the division of Botany\n",
      "usually known as Classification or \"Systematic Botany.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we may study the functions or workings of an organism: how it\n",
      "feeds, breathes, moves, reproduces. This is \"Physiology,\" and like\n",
      "classification must be preceded by a knowledge of the structures\n",
      "concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the study of the gross anatomy of plants the following articles\n",
      "will be found of great assistance: 1. a sharp knife, and for more\n",
      "delicate tissues, a razor; 2. a pair of small, fine-pointed scissors;\n",
      "3. a pair of mounted needles (these can be made by forcing ordinary\n",
      "sewing needles into handles of pine or other soft wood); 4. a hand\n",
      "lens; 5. drawing-paper and pencil, and a note book.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the study of the lower plants, as well as the histology of the\n",
      "higher ones, a compound microscope is indispensable. Instruments with\n",
      "lenses magnifying from about 20 to 500 diameters can be had at a cost\n",
      "varying from about $20 to $30, and are sufficient for any ordinary\n",
      "investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objects to be studied with the compound microscope are usually\n",
      "examined by transmitted light, and must be transparent enough to allow\n",
      "the light to pass through. The objects are placed upon small glass\n",
      "slips (slides), manufactured for the purpose, and covered with\n",
      "extremely thin plates of glass, also specially made. If the body to be\n",
      "examined is a large one, thin slices or sections must be made. This\n",
      "for most purposes may be done with an ordinary razor. Most plant\n",
      "tissues are best examined ordinarily in water, though of course\n",
      "specimens so mounted cannot be preserved for any length of time.[1]\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to the implements used in studying the gross anatomy, the\n",

      "the slides; 2. small forceps for handling delicate objects; 3.\n",

      "the simpler histological work. The most important of these are\n",
      "alcohol, glycerine, potash (a strong solution of potassium hydrate in\n",
      "water), iodine (either a little of the commercial tincture of iodine\n",
      "in water, or, better, a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium),\n",
      "acetic acid, and some staining fluid. (An aqueous or alcoholic\n",

      "A careful record should be kept by the student of all work done, both\n",

      "\n",
      "For the sake of convenience it is desirable to collect into groups\n",
      "such plants as are evidently related; but as our knowledge of many\n",
      "forms is still very imperfect, any classification we may adopt must be\n",
      "to a great extent only provisional, and subject to change at any time,\n",
      "as new forms are discovered or others become better understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following general divisions are usually accepted: I. Sub-kingdom\n",
      "(or Branch); II. Class; III. Order; IV. Family; V. Genus; VI. Species.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate: The white pine belongs to the highest great division\n",
      "(sub-kingdom) of the plant kingdom. The plants of this division all\n",
      "produce seeds, and hence are called \"spermaphytes\" (\"seed plants\").\n",
      "They may be divided into two groups (classes), distinguished by\n",
      "certain peculiarities in the flowers and seeds. These are named\n",
      "respectively \"gymnosperms\" and \"angiosperms,\" and to the first our\n",
      "plant belongs. The gymnosperms may be further divided into several\n",
      "subordinate groups (orders), one of which, the conifers, or\n",
      "cone-bearing evergreens, includes our plant. This order includes\n",
      "several families, among them the fir family (_Abietine\u00e6_), including\n",
      "the pines and firs. Of the sub-divisions (_genera_, sing. _genus_) of\n",
      "the fir family, one of the most familiar is the genus _Pinus_, which\n",
      "embraces all the true pines. Comparing different kinds of pines, we\n",
      "find that they differ in the form of the cones, arrangement of the\n",
      "leaves, and other minor particulars. The form we have selected differs\n",
      "from all other native forms in its cones, and also in having the\n",
      "leaves in fives, instead of twos or threes, as in most other kinds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Probably to be reckoned with the _Mycomycetes_, but of doubtful\n",

      "They cause the fermentation of beer and wine, as well as the incipient\n",

      "bubbles of carbonic acid gas during the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a little common yeast is put into water containing starch or sugar,\n",
      "and kept in a warm place, in a short time bubbles of gas will make\n",

      "  with a strong lens (magnifying from 500-1000 diameters) shows that\n",
      "  the protoplasm, in which are granules of varying size, does not fill\n",

      "ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when\n",
      "placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the\n",
      "majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,\n",
      "had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by\n",
      "Ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad,\n",
      "but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving\n",
      "hardihood of a Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to\n",

      "gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The\n",
      "clothes that the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him;\n",
      "and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath\n",
      "the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast and\n",
      "dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew\n",
      "all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow\n",
      "idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though\n",
      "his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee's\n",

      "they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word;\n",
      "by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal\n",

      "\n",
      "And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\n",
      "and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab\n",

      "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\n",
      "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\n",
      "downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for\n",
      "the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that\n",

      "his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon\n",
      "Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his\n",

      "to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a\n",

      "unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some\n",
      "carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the\n",

      "slightest degree approaching to decision--one of those too, whose\n",
      "faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was\n",

      "in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet\n",
