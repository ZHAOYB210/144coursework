All matter is composed of certain constituents (about seventy are atpresent known), which, so far as the chemist is concerned, areindivisible, and are known as elements.Of the innumerable combinations of these elements, two general classesmay be recognized, organic and inorganic bodies. While it isimpossible, owing to the dependence of all organized matter uponinorganic matter, to give an absolute definition, we at once recognizethe peculiarities of organic or living bodies as distinguished frominorganic or non-living ones. All living bodies feed, grow, andreproduce, these acts being the result of the action of forcesresident within the organism. Inorganic bodies, on the other hand,remain, as a rule, unchanged so long as they are not acted upon byexternal forces.All living organisms are dependent for existence upon inorganicmatter, and sooner or later return these elements to the sourceswhence they came. Thus, a plant extracts from the earth and aircertain inorganic compounds which are converted by the activity of theplant into a part of its own substance, becoming thus incorporatedinto a living organism. After the plant dies, however, it undergoesdecomposition, and the elements are returned again to the earth andatmosphere from which they were taken.Investigation has shown that living bodies contain comparatively fewelements, but these are combined into extraordinarily complexcompounds. The following elements appear to be essential to all livingbodies: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, potassium.Besides these there are several others usually present, but notapparently essential to all organisms. These include phosphorus, iron,calcium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine, silicon.As we examine more closely the structure and functions of organicbodies, an extraordinary uniformity is apparent in all of them. Thisis disguised in the more specialized forms, but in the simpler ones isvery apparent. Owing to this any attempt to separate absolutely theanimal and vegetable kingdoms proves futile.The science that treats of living things, irrespective of thedistinction between plant and animal, is called "Biology," but formany purposes it is desirable to recognize the distinctions, makingtwo departments of Biology,--Botany, treating of plants; and Zoölogy,of animals. It is with the first of these only that we shall concernourselves here.When one takes up a plant his attention is naturally first drawn toits general appearance and structure, whether it is a complicated onelike one of the flowering plants, or some humbler member of thevegetable kingdom,--a moss, seaweed, toadstool,--or even some stillsimpler plant like a mould, or the apparently structureless green scumthat floats on a stagnant pond. In any case the impulse is toinvestigate the form and structure as far as the means at one'sdisposal will permit. Such a study of structure constitutes"Morphology," which includes two departments,--gross anatomy, or ageneral study of the parts; and minute anatomy, or "Histology," inwhich a microscopic examination is made of the structure of thedifferent parts. A special department of Morphology called"Embryology" is often recognized. This embraces a study of thedevelopment of the organism from its earliest stage, and also thedevelopment of its different members.From a study of the structure of organisms we get a clue to theirrelationships, and upon the basis of such relationships are enabled toclassify them or unite them into groups so as to indicate the degreeto which they are related. This constitutes the division of Botanyusually known as Classification or "Systematic Botany."Finally, we may study the functions or workings of an organism: how itfeeds, breathes, moves, reproduces. This is "Physiology," and likeclassification must be preceded by a knowledge of the structuresconcerned.For the study of the gross anatomy of plants the following articleswill be found of great assistance: 1. a sharp knife, and for moredelicate tissues, a razor; 2. a pair of small, fine-pointed scissors;3. a pair of mounted needles (these can be made by forcing ordinarysewing needles into handles of pine or other soft wood); 4. a handlens; 5. drawing-paper and pencil, and a note book.For the study of the lower plants, as well as the histology of thehigher ones, a compound microscope is indispensable. Instruments withlenses magnifying from about 20 to 500 diameters can be had at a costvarying from about $20 to $30, and are sufficient for any ordinaryinvestigations.Objects to be studied with the compound microscope are usuallyexamined by transmitted light, and must be transparent enough to allowthe light to pass through. The objects are placed upon small glassslips (slides), manufactured for the purpose, and covered withextremely thin plates of glass, also specially made. If the body to beexamined is a large one, thin slices or sections must be made. Thisfor most purposes may be done with an ordinary razor. Most planttissues are best examined ordinarily in water, though of coursespecimens so mounted cannot be preserved for any length of time.[1][1] For the mounting of permanent preparations, see Chapter XIX.In addition to the implements used in studying the gross anatomy, thefollowing will be found useful in histological work: 1. a smallcamel's-hair brush for picking up small sections and putting water inthe slides; 2. small forceps for handling delicate objects; 3.blotting paper for removing superfluous water from the slides anddrawing fluids under the cover glass; 4. pieces of elder or sunflowerpith, for holding small objects while making sections.In addition to these implements, a few reagents may be recommended forthe simpler histological work. The most important of these arealcohol, glycerine, potash (a strong solution of potassium hydrate inwater), iodine (either a little of the commercial tincture of iodinein water, or, better, a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium),acetic acid, and some staining fluid. (An aqueous or alcoholicsolution of gentian violet or methyl violet is one of the best.)A careful record should be kept by the student of all work done, bothby means of written notes and drawings. For most purposes pencildrawings are most convenient, and these should be made with amoderately soft pencil on unruled paper. If it is desired to make thedrawings with ink, a careful outline should first be made with a hardpencil and this inked over with India-ink or black drawing ink. Inkdrawings are best made upon light bristol board with a hard,smooth-finished surface.When obtainable, the student will do best to work with freshlygathered specimens; but as these are not always to be had when wanted,a few words about gathering and preserving material may be of service.Most of the lower green plants (_algæ_) may be kept for a long time inglass jars or other vessels, provided care is taken to remove alldead specimens at first and to renew the water from time to time. Theyusually thrive best in a north window where they get little or nodirect sunshine, and it is well to avoid keeping them too warm.Numbers of the most valuable fungi--_i.e._ the lower plants that arenot green--grow spontaneously on many organic substances that are keptwarm and moist. Fresh bread kept moist and covered with a glass willin a short time produce a varied crop of moulds, and fresh horsemanure kept in the same way serves to support a still greater numberof fungi.Mosses, ferns, etc., can be raised with a little care, and of coursevery many flowering plants are readily grown in pots.Most of the smaller parasitic fungi (rusts, mildews, etc.) may be keptdry for any length of time, and on moistening with a weak solution ofcaustic potash will serve nearly as well as freshly gathered specimensfor most purposes.When it is desired to preserve as perfectly as possible the moredelicate plant structures for future study, strong alcohol is the bestand most convenient preserving agent. Except for loss of color itpreserves nearly all plant tissues perfectly.If we make a thin slice across the stem of a rapidly growingplant,--_e.g._ geranium, begonia, celery,--mount it in water, andexamine it microscopically, it will be found to be made up of numerouscavities or chambers separated by delicate partitions. Often thesecavities are of sufficient size to be visible to the naked eye, andexamined with a hand lens the section appears like a piece of finelace, each mesh being one of the chambers visible when more stronglymagnified. These chambers are known as "cells," and of them the wholeplant is built up.  In order to study the structure of the cell more exactly we will  select such as may be examined without cutting them. A good example  is furnished by the common spiderwort (Fig. 1). Attached to the base  of the stamens (Fig. 85, _B_) are delicate hairs composed of chains  of cells, which may be examined alive by carefully removing a stamen  and placing it in a drop of water under a cover glass. Each cell  (Fig. 1) is an oblong sac, with a delicate colorless wall which  chemical tests show to be composed of cellulose, a substance closely  resembling starch. Within this sac, and forming a lining to it, is  a thin layer of colorless matter containing many fine granules.  Bands and threads of the same substance traverse the cavity of the  cell, which is filled with a deep purple homogeneous fluid. This  fluid, which in most cells is colorless, is called the cell sap, and  is composed mainly of water. Imbedded in the granular lining of the  sac is a roundish body (_n_), which itself has a definite membrane,  and usually shows one or more roundish bodies within, besides an  indistinctly granular appearance. This body is called the nucleus of  the cell, and the small one within it, the nucleolus.  The membrane surrounding the cell is known as the cell wall, and in  young plant cells is always composed of cellulose.  The granular substance lining the cell wall (Fig. 1, _pr._) is  called "protoplasm," and with the nucleus constitutes the living  part of the cell. If sufficiently magnified, the granules within the  protoplasm will be seen to be in active streaming motion. This  movement, which is very evident here, is not often so conspicuous,  but still may often be detected without difficulty.The cell may be regarded as the unit of organic structure, and ofcells are built up all of the complicated structures of which thebodies of the highest plants and animals are composed. We shall findthat the cells may become very much modified for various purposes, butat first they are almost identical in structure, and essentially thesame as the one we have just considered.Very many of the lower forms of life consist of but a single cellwhich may occasionally be destitute of a cell wall. Such a form isshown in Figure 2. Here we have a mass of protoplasm with a nucleus(_n_) and cavities (vacuoles, _v_) filled with cell sap, but no cellwall. The protoplasm is in constant movement, and by extensions of aportion of the mass and contraction of other parts, the whole creepsslowly along. Other naked cells (Fig. 12, _B_; Fig. 16, _C_) areprovided with delicate thread-like processes of protoplasm called"cilia" (sing. _cilium_), which are in active vibration, and propelthe cell through the water.  On placing a cell into a fluid denser than the cell sap (_e.g._ a  ten-per-cent solution of sugar in water), a portion of the water  will be extracted from the cell, and we shall then see the  protoplasm receding from the wall (Fig. 4, _C_), showing that it is  normally in a state of tension due to pressure from within of the  cell sap. The cell wall shows the same thing though in a less  degree, owing to its being much more rigid than the protoplasmic  lining. It is owing to the partial collapsing of the cells,  consequent on loss of water, that plants wither when the supply of  water is cut off.As cells grow, new ones are formed in various ways. If the new cellsremain together, cell aggregates, called tissues, are produced, andof these tissues are built up the various organs of the higher plants.The simplest tissues are rows of cells, such as form the hairscovering the surface of the organs of many flowering plants (Fig. 3),and are due to a division of the cells in a single direction. If thedivisions take place in three planes, masses of cells, such as make upthe stems, etc., of the higher plants, result (Fig. 4, _A_, _B_).The name Protophytes (_Protophyta_) has been applied to a large numberof simple plants, which differ a good deal among themselves. Some ofthem differ strikingly from the higher plants, and resemble soremarkably certain low forms of animal life as to be quiteindistinguishable from them, at least in certain stages. Indeed, thereare certain forms that are quite as much animal as vegetable in theirattributes, and must be regarded as connecting the two kingdoms. Suchforms are the slime moulds (Fig. 5), _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), _Volvox_(Fig. 10), and others.Other protophytes, while evidently enough of vegetable nature, arenevertheless very different in some respects from the higher plants.These curious organisms are among the most puzzling forms with whichthe botanist has to do, as they are so much like some of the lowestforms of animal life as to be scarcely distinguishable from them, andindeed they are sometimes regarded as animals rather than plants. Atcertain stages they consist of naked masses of protoplasm of veryconsiderable size, not infrequently several centimetres in diameter.These are met with on decaying logs in damp woods, on rotting leaves,and other decaying vegetable matter. The commonest ones are brightyellow or whitish, and form soft, slimy coverings over the substratum(Fig. 5, _A_), penetrating into its crevices and showing sensitivenesstoward light. The plasmodium, as the mass of protoplasm is called, maybe made to creep upon a slide in the following way: A tumbler isfilled with water and placed in a saucer filled with sand. A strip ofblotting paper about the width of the slide is now placed with one endin the water, the other hanging over the edge of the glass and againstone side of a slide, which is thus held upright, but must not beallowed to touch the side of the tumbler. The strip of blotting papersucks up the water, which flows slowly down the surface of the slidein contact with the blotting paper. If now a bit of the substance uponwhich the plasmodium is growing is placed against the bottom of theslide on the side where the stream of water is, the protoplasm willcreep up against the current of water and spread over the slide,forming delicate threads in which most active streaming movements ofthe central granular protoplasm may be seen under the microscope, andthe ends of the branches may be seen to push forward much as we saw inthe amœba. In order that the experiment may be successful, the wholeapparatus should be carefully protected from the light, and allowed tostand for several hours. This power of movement, as well as the powerto take in solid food, are eminently animal characteristics, thoughthe former is common to many plants as well.After a longer or shorter time the mass of protoplasm contracts andgathers into little heaps, each of which develops into a structurethat has no resemblance to any animal, but would be at once placedwith plants. In one common form (_Trichia_) these are round orpear-shaped bodies of a yellow color, and about as big as a pin head(Fig. 5, _D_), occurring in groups on rotten logs in damp woods.Others are stalked (_Arcyria_, _Stemonitis_) (Fig. 5, _J_, _K_), andof various colors,--red, brown, etc. The outer part of the structureis a more or less firm wall, which breaks when ripe, discharging apowdery mass, mixed in most forms with very fine fibres.  When strongly magnified the fine dust is found to be made up of  innumerable small cells with thick walls, marked with ridges or  processes which differ much in different species. The fibres also  differ much in different genera. Sometimes they are simple,  hair-like threads; in others they are hollow tubes with spiral  thickenings, often very regularly placed, running around their  walls.  The spores may sometimes be made to germinate by placing them in a  drop of water, and allowing them to remain in a warm place for about  twenty-four hours. If the experiment has been successful, at the end  of this time the spore membrane will have burst, and the contents  escaped in the form of a naked mass of protoplasm (Zoöspore) with a  nucleus, and often showing a vacuole (Fig. 5, _v_), that  alternately becomes much distended, and then disappears entirely. On  first escaping it is usually provided with a long, whip-like  filament of protoplasm, which is in active movement, and by means of  which the cell swims actively through the water (Fig. 5, _I_ i).  Sometimes such a cell will be seen to divide into two, the process  taking but a short time, so that the numbers of these cells under  favorable conditions may become very large. After a time the lash is  withdrawn, and the cell assumes much the form of a small amœba (_I_  ii).The succeeding stages are difficult to follow. After repeatedlydividing, a large number of these amœba-like cells run together,coalescing when they come in contact, and forming a mass of protoplasmthat grows, and finally assumes the form from which it started.  Of the common forms of slime moulds the species of _Trichia_ (Figs.  _D_, _I_) and _Physarum_ are, perhaps, the best for studying the  germination, as the spores are larger than in most other forms, and  germinate more readily. The experiment is apt to be most successful  if the spores are sown in a drop of water in which has been infused  some vegetable matter, such as a bit of rotten wood, boiling  thoroughly to kill all germs. A drop of this fluid should be placed  on a perfectly clean cover glass, which it is well to pass once or  twice through a flame, and the spores transferred to this drop with  a needle previously heated. By these precautions foreign germs will  be avoided, which otherwise may interfere seriously with the growth  of the young slime moulds. After sowing the spores in the drop of  culture fluid, the whole should be inverted over a so-called "moist  chamber." This is simply a square of thick blotting paper, in which  an opening is cut small enough to be entirely covered by the cover  glass, but large enough so that the drop in the centre of the cover  glass will not touch the sides of the chamber, but will hang  suspended clear in it. The blotting paper should be soaked  thoroughly in pure water (distilled water is preferable), and then  placed on a slide, covering carefully with the cover glass with the  suspended drop of fluid containing the spores. The whole should be  kept under cover so as to prevent loss of water by evaporation. By  this method the spores may be examined conveniently without  disturbing them, and the whole may be kept as long as desired, so  long as the blotting paper is kept wet, so as to prevent the  suspended drop from drying up.The Schizophytes are very small plants, though not infrequentlyoccurring in masses of considerable size. They are among the commonestof all plants, and are found everywhere. They multiply almost entirelyby simple transverse division, or splitting of the cells, whence theirname. There are two pretty well-marked orders,--the blue-green slimes(_Cyanophyceæ_) and the bacteria (_Schizomycetes_). They aredistinguished, primarily, by the first (with a very few exceptions)containing chlorophyll (leaf-green), which is entirely absent fromnearly all of the latter.The blue-green slimes: These are, with few exceptions, green plants ofsimple structure, but possessing, in addition to the ordinary greenpigment (chlorophyll, or leaf-green), another coloring matter, solublein water, and usually blue in color, though sometimes yellowish orred.As a representative of the group, we will select one of the commonestforms (_Oscillaria_), known sometimes as green slime, from forming adark blue-green or blackish slimy coat over the mud at the bottom ofstagnant or sluggish water, in watering troughs, on damp rocks, oreven on moist earth. A search in the places mentioned can hardly failto secure plenty of specimens for study. If a bit of the slimy mass istransferred to a china dish, or placed with considerable water on apiece of stiff paper, after a short time the edge of the mass willshow numerous extremely fine filaments of a dark blue-green color,radiating in all directions from the mass (Fig. 6, _a_). The filamentsare the individual plants, and possess considerable power of motion,as is shown by letting the mass remain undisturbed for a day or two,at the end of which time they will have formed a thin film over thesurface of the vessel in which they are kept; and the radiatingarrangement of the filaments can then be plainly seen.If the mass is allowed to dry on the paper, it often leaves a brightblue stain, due to the blue pigment in the cells of the filament. Thisblue color can also be extracted by pulverizing a quantity of thedried plants, and pouring water over them, the water soon becomingtinged with a decided blue. If now the water containing the bluepigment is filtered, and the residue treated with alcohol, the latterwill extract the chlorophyll, becoming colored of a yellow-green.  The microscope shows that the filaments of which the mass is  composed (Fig. 6, _B_) are single rows of short cylindrical cells of  uniform diameter, except at the end of the filament, where they  usually become somewhat smaller, so that the tip is more or less  distinctly pointed. The protoplasm of the cells has a few small  granules scattered through it, and is colored uniformly of a pale  blue-green. No nucleus can be seen.  If the filament is broken, there may generally be detected a  delicate, colorless sheath that surrounds it, and extends beyond the  end cells (Fig. 6, _c_). The filament increases in length by the  individual cells undergoing division, this always taking place at  right angles to the axis of the filament. New filaments are produced  simply by the older ones breaking into a number of pieces, each of  which rapidly grows to full size.The name "oscillaria" arises from the peculiar oscillating or swingingmovements that the plant exhibits. The most marked movement is aswaying from side to side, combined with a rotary motion of the freeends of the filaments, which are often twisted together like thestrands of a rope. If the filaments are entirely free, they may oftenbe observed to move forward with a slow, creeping movement. Just howthese movements are caused is still a matter of controversy.The lowest of the _Cyanophyceæ_ are strictly single-celled, separatingas soon as formed, but cohering usually in masses or colonies by meansof a thick mucilaginous substance that surrounds them (Fig. 7, _D_).The higher ones are filaments, in which there may be considerabledifferentiation. These often occur in masses of considerable size,forming jelly-like lumps, which may be soft or quite firm (Fig. 7,_A_, _B_). They are sometimes found on damp ground, but more commonlyattached to plants, stones, etc., in water. The masses vary in colorfrom light brown to deep blackish green, and in size from that of apin head to several centimetres in diameter.In the higher forms special cells called heterocysts are found. Theyare colorless, or light yellowish, regularly disposed; but theirfunction is not known. Besides these, certain cells becomethick-walled, and form resting cells (spores) for the propagation ofthe plant (Fig. 7, C. _sp._). In species where the sheath of thefilament is well marked (Fig. 7, _H_), groups of cells slip out of thesheath, and develop a new one, thus giving rise to a new plant.The bacteria (_Schizomycetes_), although among the commonest oforganisms, owing to their excessive minuteness, are difficult tostudy, especially for the beginner. They resemble, in their generalstructure and methods of reproduction, the blue-green slimes, but are,with very few exceptions, destitute of chlorophyll, although oftenpossessing bright pigments,--blue, violet, red, etc. It is one ofthese that sometimes forms blood-red spots in flour paste or bits ofbread that have been kept very moist and warm. They are universallypresent where decomposition is going on, and are themselves theprincipal agents of decay, which is the result of their feeding uponthe substance, as, like all plants without chlorophyll, they requireorganic matter for food. Most of the species are very tenacious oflife, and may be completely dried up for a long time without dying,and on being placed in water will quickly revive. Being so extremelysmall, they are readily carried about in the air in their dried-upcondition, and thus fall upon exposed bodies, setting up decompositionif the conditions are favorable.A simple experiment to show this may be performed by taking two testtubes and partly filling them with an infusion of almost any organicsubstance (dried leaves or hay, or a bit of meat will answer). Thefluid should now be boiled so as to kill any germs that may be in it;and while hot, one of the vessels should be securely stopped up with aplug of cotton wool, and the other left open. The cotton preventsaccess of all solid particles, but allows the air to enter. If propercare has been taken, the infusion in the closed vessel will remainunchanged indefinitely; but the other will soon become turbid, and adisagreeable odor will be given off. Microscopic examination shows thefirst to be free from germs of any kind, while the second is swarmingwith various forms of bacteria.These little organisms have of late years attracted the attention ofvery many scientists, from the fact that to them is due many, if notall, contagious diseases. The germs of many such diseases have beenisolated, and experiments prove beyond doubt that these are alone thecauses of the diseases in question.  If a drop of water containing bacteria is examined, we find them to  be excessively small, many of them barely visible with the strongest  lenses. The larger ones (Fig. 8) recall quite strongly the smaller  species of oscillaria, and exhibit similar movements. Others are so  small as to appear as mere lines and dots, even with the strongest  lenses. Among the common forms are small, nearly globular cells;  oblong, rod-shaped or thread-shaped filaments, either straight or  curved, or even spirally twisted. Frequently they show a quick  movement which is probably in all cases due to cilia, which are,  however, too small to be seen in most cases.Reproduction is for the most part by simple transverse division, as inoscillaria; but occasionally spores are produced also.This group of the protophytes is unquestionably closely related tocertain low animals (_Monads_ or _Flagellata_), with which they aresometimes united. They are characterized by being actively motile, andare either strictly unicellular, or the cells are united by agelatinous envelope into a colony of definite form.Of the first group, _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), may be selected as a type.  This organism is found frequently among other algæ, and occasionally  forms a green film on stagnant water. It is sometimes regarded as a  plant, sometimes as an animal, and is an elongated, somewhat  worm-like cell without a definite cell wall, so that it can change  its form to some extent. The protoplasm contains oval masses, which  are bright green in color; but the forward pointed end of the cell  is colorless, and has a little depression. At this end there is a  long vibratile protoplasmic filament (_c_), by means of which the  cell moves. There is also to be seen near this end a red speck (_e_)  which is probably sensitive to light. A nucleus can usually be seen  if the cell is first killed with an iodine solution, which often  will render the flagellum (_c_) more evident, this being invisible  while the cell is in motion. The cells multiply by division.  Previous to this the flagellum is withdrawn, and a firm cell wall is  formed about the cell (Fig. 9, _B_). The contents then divide into  two or more parts, which afterwards escape as new individuals.Of the forms that are united in colonies[2] one of the best known is_Volvox_ (Fig. 10). This plant is sometimes found in quiet water,where it floats on or near the surface as a dark green ball, justlarge enough to be seen with the naked eye. They may be kept for sometime in aquaria, and will sometimes multiply rapidly, but are verysusceptible to extremes of temperature, especially of heat.[2] The term "colony" is, perhaps, inappropriate, as the whole mass ofcells arises from a single one, and may properly be looked upon as anindividual plant.  The colony (Fig. 10, _A_) is a hollow sphere, the numerous green  cells of which it is composed forming a single layer on the outside.  By killing with iodine, and using a strong lens, each cell is seen  to be somewhat pear-shaped (Fig. _B_), with the pointed end out.  Attached to this end are two vibratile filaments (cilia or  _flagella_), and the united movements of these cause the rolling  motion of the whole colony. Usually a number of young colonies  (Fig. _x_) are found within the mother colony. These arise by the  repeated bipartition of a single cell, and escape finally, forming  independent colonies.  Another (sexual) form of reproduction occurs, similar to that found  in many higher plants; but as it only occurs at certain seasons, it  is not likely to be met with by the student.Other forms related to _Volvox_, and sometimes met with, are_Gonium_, in which there are sixteen cells, forming a flat square;_Pandorina_ and _Eudorina_, with sixteen cells, forming an oval orglobular colony like _Volvox_, but much smaller. In all of these thestructure of the cells is essentially as in _Volvox_.[3] Algæ (sing. _alga_).In the second sub-kingdom of plants is embraced an enormous assemblageof plants, differing widely in size and complexity, and yet showing asufficiently complete gradation from the lowest to the highest as tomake it impracticable to make more than one sub-kingdom to includethem. They are nearly all aquatic forms, although many of them willsurvive long periods of drying, such forms occurring on moist earth,rocks, or the trunks of trees, but only growing when there is aplentiful supply of water.All of them possess chlorophyll, which, however, in many forms, ishidden by the presence of a brown or red pigment. They are ordinarilydivided into three classes--I. The Green Algæ (_Chlorophyceæ_);The green algæ are to be found almost everywhere where there ismoisture, but are especially abundant in sluggish or stagnant freshwater, being much less common in salt water. They are for the mostpart plants of simple structure, many being unicellular, and very fewof them plants of large size.We may recognize five well-marked orders of the green algæ--I. Greenslimes (_Protococcaceæ_); II. _Confervaceæ_; III. Pond scums(_Conjugatæ_); IV. _Siphoneæ_; V. Stone-worts (_Characeæ_).The members of this order are minute unicellular plants, growingeither in water or on the damp surfaces of stones, tree trunks, etc.The plants sometimes grow isolated, but usually the cells are unitedmore or less regularly into colonies.A common representative of the order is the common green slime,_Protococcus_ (Fig. 11, _A_, _C_), which forms a dark green slimycoating over stones, tree trunks, flower pots, etc. Owing to theirminute size the structure can only be made out with the microscope.  Scraping off a little of the material mentioned into a drop of water  upon a slide, and carefully separating it with needles, a cover  glass may be placed over the preparation, and it is ready for  examination. When magnified, the green film is found to be composed  of minute globular cells of varying size, which may in places be  found to be united into groups. With a higher power, each cell  (Fig. 11, _A_) is seen to have a distinct cell wall, within which is  colorless protoplasm. Careful examination shows that the chlorophyll  is confined to several roundish bodies that are not usually in  immediate contact with the wall of the cell. These green masses are  called chlorophyll bodies (chloroplasts). Toward the centre of the  cell, especially if it has first been treated with iodine, the  nucleus may be found. The size of the cells, as well as the number  of chloroplasts, varies a good deal.  With a little hunting, specimens in various stages of division may  be found. The division takes place in two ways. In the first  (Fig. 11, _B_), known as fission, a wall is formed across the cell,  dividing it into two cells, which may separate immediately or may  remain united until they have undergone further division. In this  case the original cell wall remains as part of the wall of the  daughter cells. Fission is the commonest form of cell multiplication  throughout the vegetable kingdom.  The second form of cell division or internal cell division is shown  at _C_. Here the protoplasm and nucleus repeatedly divide until a  number of small cells are formed within the old one. These develop  cell walls, and escape by the breaking of the old cell wall, which  is left behind, and takes no part in the process. The cells thus  formed are sometimes provided with two cilia, and are capable of  active movement.  Internal cell division, as we shall see, is found in most plants,  but only at special times.  Closely resembling _Protococcus_, and answering quite as well for  study, are numerous aquatic forms, such as _Chlorococcum_ (Fig. 12).  These are for the most part destitute of a firm cell wall, but are  imbedded in masses of gelatinous substance like many _Cyanophyceæ_.  The chloroplasts are smaller and less distinct than in  _Protococcus_. The cells are here oval rather than round, and often  show a clear space at one end.  Owing to the absence of a definite membrane, a distinction between  fission and internal cell division can scarcely be made here. Often  the cells escape from the gelatinous envelope, and swim actively by  means of two cilia at the colorless end (Fig. 12, _B_). In this  stage they closely resemble the individuals of a _Volvox_ colony, or  other green _Flagellata_, to which there is little doubt that they  are related.  There are a number of curious forms common in fresh water that are  probably related to _Protococcus_, but differ in having the cells  united in colonies of definite form. Among the most striking are  the different species of _Pediastrum_ (Fig. 11, _D_, _E_), often met  with in company with other algæ, and growing readily in aquaria when  once established. They are of very elegant shapes, and the number of  cells some multiple of four, usually sixteen.  The cells form a flat disc, the outer ones being generally provided  with a pair of spines.  New individuals arise by internal division of the cells, the  contents of each forming as many parts as there are cells in the  whole colony. The young cells now escape through a cleft in the wall  of the mother cell, but are still surrounded by a delicate membrane  (Fig. 11, _E_). Within this membrane the young cells arrange  themselves in the form of the original colony, and grow together,  forming a new colony.  A much larger but rarer form is the water net (Fig. 11, _G_), in  which the colony has the form of a hollow net, the spaces being  surrounded by long cylindrical cells placed end to end. Other common  forms belong to the genus _Scenedesmus_ (Fig. 11, _F_), of which  there are many species.Under this head are included a number of forms of which the simplestones approach closely, especially in their younger stages, the_Protococcaceæ_. Indeed, some of the so-called _Protococcaceæ_ areknown to be only the early stages of these plants.A common member of this order is _Cladophora_, a coarse-branchingalga, growing commonly in running water, where it forms tufts,sometimes a metre or more in length. By floating out a little of it ina saucer, it is easy to see that it is made up of branching filaments.
